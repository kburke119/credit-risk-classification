# credit-risk-classification

Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis.
- To build a model that can successfully identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model. 
- Accuracy: Our model achieved an accuracy of .99. This means that is can correctly predict the loan labels for 99% of the samples within the dataset. 
- Precision: Label '0' is 1.00 meaning that it always predicts a loan as healthy when it is healthy. 
- Recall: Label '0' recall is .99 meaning that the model can identify the majority of the actual healthy loans correctly. 

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
- I'm recommending that we use the logisitic regression model trained on the provided dataset as it performs very highly. The high accuracy, precision, and recall scores indicate that it can predict loan labels by distinguishing between healthy and high risk loans.
